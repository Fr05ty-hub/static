# Email Templates

### How to construct (from mjml to html)
Utilize [mjml.io/try-it-live](https://mjml.io/try-it-live/) to cut the file `mj-source.html` to fit the mail template you want to construct. The output will be an HTML template with jinja2 placeholders for variables, ie. `{{ company_name }}`, `{{ signee_name }}` etc.

The template can be installed in flow, by going to the admin page and creating an email template.

### Danish templates
A backup of the danish templates (in mjml) has been made, as they involve copy+pasting danish text from excel or invision.
