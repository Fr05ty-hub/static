### How to construct
Utilize [mjml.io/try-it-live](https://mjml.io/try-it-live/) to cut the file `mj-source.html` to fit the mail template you want to construct.

### Danish templates
A backup of the danish templates (in mjml) has been made, as they involve copy+pasting danish text from excel or invision.
